        <h2 style="color: white;">1. Pan-Searing</h2>
        <p>
          Pan-searing is one of the easiest and tastiest ways to cook steak. By using a super-hot skillet-usually cast iron-you get a golden-brown crust on the outside while the inside stays juicy and tender. Many cooks add butter, garlic, and herbs like rosemary or thyme during the last minutes of cooking, then spoon the melted butter over the steak for extra flavor. This method is quick, works indoors, and is perfect for weeknight dinners or whenever you want a simple, restaurant-style steak at home.

        <h2 style="color: white;">2. Grilling</h2>
        <p>
          Grilling is the go-to method for many steak lovers because of its smoky flavor and charred texture. Cooking over charcoal adds a bold, earthy smokiness, while gas grills give you more control and consistency. The high heat creates iconic grill marks and a crisp crust while sealing in the juices. Grilling also makes steak a social experience-perfect for outdoor barbecues and gatherings. It's especially great for cuts like ribeye, sirloin, and strip, which thrive with that smoky, flame-kissed taste.

        <h2 style="color: white;">3. Smoking</h2>
        <p>
          Smoking steak is all about slow cooking over low, indirect heat while infusing it with rich, smoky flavor from burning wood chips like hickory, oak, or mesquite. Unlike grilling or pan-searing, smoking takes patience, often a few hours depending on the cut and thickness. The result is a tender steak with a deep, smoky aroma that pairs beautifully with its natural beefiness. This method works best with thicker cuts such as ribeye or brisket-style steaks, and it's especially popular among barbecue lovers who enjoy bold flavors and a melt-in-your-mouth texture.

        <h2 style="color: white;">4. Sous Vide</h2>
        <p>
          Sous vide is a high-tech but almost foolproof way to cook steak. The process involves sealing the steak in a bag and cooking it slowly in a warm water bath at a precise temperature. This ensures the steak is cooked evenly all the way through, edge to edge, without overcooking. Once it's ready, the steak is quickly seared in a pan or on the grill to get that perfect crust. While it takes more time and equipment, sous vide guarantees consistency and is loved by people who want steak cooked exactly the way they like it every single time.

        <h2 style="color: white;">5. Reverse Searing</h2>
        <p>
          Reverse searing is a clever two-step process. First, the steak is cooked slowly at a low temperature-usually in the oven or on a grill-until it's almost done. Then it's seared over very high heat to develop a flavorful crust. This method gives you full control over doneness, so your steak turns out evenly cooked inside without burning the outside. It's ideal for thick cuts like ribeye, tomahawk, or porterhouse, and it's a favorite among steak enthusiasts who want both precision and a perfect sear.
