        <h2 style="color: white;">1. Rare</h2>
        <p>
          Rare steak is cooked very quickly at high heat, leaving the inside cool, red, and extremely juicy. It reaches an internal temperature of about 125&deg;F (52&deg;C). This level of doneness highlights the natural flavor of the beef with minimal cooking, making it very tender and almost buttery. Rare is often preferred by steak lovers who want to experience the steak's full, natural taste without losing moisture.

        <p>
          Medium rare is often considered the "gold standard" of steak doneness. Cooked to about 130-135&deg;F (54-57&deg;C), the steak has a warm red center surrounded by a beautifully seared crust. It balances tenderness, juiciness, and flavor, making it a favorite among chefs and diners alike. This doneness level brings out the best qualities of premium cuts like ribeye and tenderloin.

        <h2 style="color: white;">3. Medium</h2>
        <p>
          Medium steak is cooked to around 140-145&deg;F (60-63&deg;C), leaving a warm pink center. It has a firmer texture than medium rare but still retains a good amount of juiciness. Many people prefer medium because it feels more "cooked through" while still being flavorful and tender. It's often a safe choice for people who are unsure of how they like their steak cooked.

        <h2 style="color: white;">4. Medium Well</h2>
        <p>
          Medium well steak reaches about 150-155&deg;F (65-68&deg;C) and has just a hint of pink left in the center. At this level, the steak is mostly firm with only slight juiciness. While it may sacrifice some tenderness, medium well appeals to those who enjoy a more fully cooked steak without it being completely dry. It's a popular choice for diners who want a hearty, cooked flavor with less redness.

        <h2 style="color: white;">5. Well Done</h2>
        <p>
          Well done steak is cooked to 160&deg;F (71&deg;C) and above, with no pink left inside. The meat becomes firm, chewy, and less juicy, but some people prefer the fully cooked texture and flavor. A well-done steak often relies on marinades, sauces, or butter to add back some moisture and richness. Though it's the most controversial doneness level among steak enthusiasts, it remains a common choice for those who enjoy their meat thoroughly cooked.
